Reliability of rankings, a previously qualitative property, is quantified in this paper by the closeness between ground truth rankings and the rankings of teams at the end of a tournament. Three metrics are used to measure this closeness: Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient, Kendall\u2019s tau, and a relatively unused algorithm in the field of ranking: Levenshtein distance. Three tournament structures are simulated: round-robin, random pairings, and the Swiss system. The tournaments are simulated across multiple trials and over a varying number of games. It is found that the rate of growth of reliability of a tournament structure falls as the number of games increases. It is also found that there is a positive relationship between competitive imbalance and reliability. The marginal benefit of increasing competitive imbalance falls as it is increased. Unexpectedly, in comparison to random pairings and Swiss pairings, the round-robin tournament structure is seen to achieve the highest reliability score across all metrics and number of games played. The difference in reliability between the tournament structures increases as competitive imbalance is increased. The further work suggested includes investigation of tournament outcome uncertainty in conjunction with reliability and competitive balance, a closer study into Levenshtein distance as a useful algorithm to quantify closeness between two rankings, and an inquiry into the specific factors that bottleneck reliability while the number of games played in a tournament increases.","link":"https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Documents/S136704PDF.pdf?ver=2021-03-01-130112-520","volumelink":"https://siam.org/publications/siuro/volume-14","start":"July 2020","end":"September 2020"},{"name":"On detecting face cycles in incrementally constructed planar graphs","position":"Research Project","description":"While programming \\"Pentalink\\", a turn-based strategy game, I had to solve a computational geometry problem using an algorithm found in \\"Polygon Detection from a Set of Lines\\" by A.

After realizing that I can approach this using a wireframe solution from solid modelling, I conducted research comparing the computational complexity of the two approaches under Dr Sashikumar, whom I met during my internship, now a research scientist at Google.

","abstract":"In planar graphs, detecting faces enclosed between its edges is extremely useful for geometrical analysis and rendering in computer graphics. An established method to compute a list of faces embedded within the planar graph is by constructing polygons through the minimum cycle basis of the graph, an algorithm which is known to run in cubic time. However, when planar graphs are incrementally constructed, it is shown that maintaining a wireframe model of the graph using half-edges is less computationally expensive. Incremental construction of a planar graph is considered in this paper as the addition of edges, one-by-one, to a planar structure. It is also shown empirically and mathematically that building and maintaining a wireframe model of planar graphs not constructed incrementally is computationally cheaper than the already established method of employing the minimum cycle basis algorithm. Further work suggested includes similar research for representing and detecting faces within three dimensional structures, and optimising the process of edge addition to the wireframe model.","start":"October 2019","end":"March 2019"}]')},49:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"videoid":"zF7hCP0FSko"},{"videoid":"MOUC6x_Lm10"}]')},59:function(e,t,n){},91:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t);n(53),n(54);var a=n(1),s=n.n(a),i=n(18),r=n.n(i),o=(n(59),n(4)),c=n(11),l=n(12),d=n(15),h=n(14),m=n(26),u=n(95),p=n(96),b=n(99),j=n(0),g=function(e){Object(d.a)(n,e);var t=Object(h.a)(n);function n(e){var a;return Object(c.a)(this,n),(a=t.call(this,e)).state={isNavOpen:!1},a.toggleNav=a.toggleNav.bind(Object(m.a)(a)),a}return Object(l.a)(n,[{key:"toggleNav",value:function(){this.setState({isNavOpen:!this.state.isNavOpen})}},{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(j.jsx)(u.a,{className:"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light",children:Object(j.jsxs)("div",{className:"container",children:[Object(j.jsx)(o.c,{className:"nav-link navbar-brand",to:"/home",children:"Vishnu Nittoor"}),Object(j.jsx)(p.a,{onClick:this.toggleNav}),Object(j.jsx)(b.a,{isOpen:this.state.isNavOpen,navbar:!0,children:Object(j.jsxs)("div",{className:"navbar-nav",children:[Object(j.jsx)(o.c,{className:"nav-link px-3",to:"/home",children:"Home"}),Object(j.jsx)(o.c,{className:"nav-link px-3",to:"/research",children:"Research and Work"}),Object(j.jsx)(o.c,{className:"nav-link px-3",to:"/projects",children:"Projects"}),Object(j.jsx)(o.c,{className:"nav-link px-3",to:"/talks",children:"Talks/Videos"}),Object(j.jsx)(o.c,{className:"nav-link px-3",to:"/organisations",children:"Organisations"}),Object(j.jsx)(o.c,{className:"nav-link px-3",to:"/education",children:"Education"}),Object(j.jsx)("a",{className:"nav-link px-3",target:"_blank",href:"/resume.pdf",children:"Resume"})]})})]})})}}]),n}(a.Component);var f=function(e){return Object(j.jsx)("div",{class:"footer",children:Object(j.jsx)("div",{className:"container",children:Object(j.jsx)("div",{className:"row justify-content-center",children:Object(j.jsx)("div",{className:"col-12"})})})})},y=n(40),x=function(e){Object(d.a)(n,e);var t=Object(h.a)(n);function n(){return Object(c.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(l.a)(n,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(j.jsx)(j.Fragment,{children:Object(j.jsxs)("div",{className:"jumbotron bg-transparent",children:[Object(j.jsx)("h1",{className:"display-4",children:"Hi, I'm Vishnu."}),Object(j.jsx)("p",{className:"lead",children:"I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying computer science and mathematics.
